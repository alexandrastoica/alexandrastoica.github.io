About Motivation: How Mindfulness Apps for Anxiety Support\n      Behaviour Change</h1>\n    <p class=\"subtitle\">Extended abstract that explores how mindfulness apps apply\n      motivation theories</p>\n    <p>\n    From January to April 2018, I explored mindfulness apps (mainly meditation apps)\n    through the lenses of motivation theories (i.e. Self-determination theory) and\n    positive computing. The primary research was supported by surveys,\n    auto-ethnographic approaches and systematic reviews. This project was part of my\n    MSc Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility and Assistive Technologies module.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    This article summarises a University assignment paper. You can check <a\n    href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZSYdIx2HKhR60WtpyIBmzVYOvf9tQin/view?usp=sharing\">the\n    original paper with in depth analysis and references as PDF</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Abstract</h2>\n    <p>\n    Extensive research shows that mindfulness-based interventions can be highly\n    effective when it comes to dealing with anxiety. Ubiquitous computing has made\n    it possible for people seeking to overcome anxiety to easily access such\n    interventions through their smartphone. However, some studies indicated that\n    users tend to have inconsistent patterns of use and often lead to abandonment\n    because of lack of motivation. In an era where positive computing emerges, it is\n    important to address the motivational aspect of health interventions. In this\n    study we take an auto-ethnographic approach to help inform evaluation of the\n    motivation aspects applied in mindfulness apps through the lens of\n    Self-Determination Theory. We thereby propose a set of design implications and\n    future refinements.\n    </p>\n    <h2>How can tech help with anxiety?</h2>\n    <p>\n    Anxiety disorders and depression have become the most prevalent mental\n    disorders, with <a\n    href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180328140249tf_/http://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21748\">1\n    in 6 people reporting having experienced them within the UK</a>. Over the last\n    years, there has been an interest into assistive technologies that focus on\n    wellbeing, stress management and exercise in the human-computer interaction\n    (HCI) area, more specifically in <a\n    href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2544103\">affective computing</a> and <a\n    href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/positive-computing\">positive computing</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Positive Computing</h3>\n    <p>\n    The term <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/positive-computing\">\"positive\n    computing\"</a> was proposed as an emerging design approach that aims to be as\n    influential as human-centred design (HCD). This is introduced because, despite\n    technology’s potential to enable users to achieve goals easier and have access\n    to unlimited information, therefore improve lives, there has not been an\n    improvement in their psychological wellbeing. The effects are rather detrimental\n    in this aspect.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    This concept draws on <a\n    href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-13324-001\">Seligman and\n    Csikszentmihalyi’s positive psychology</a> which focuses on human wellbeing and\n    aims to uncover what makes people’s life worth living though valued subjective\n    experiences. Another basis of positive computing is <a\n    href=\"http://www.ijdesign.org/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/1666\">Desmet et\n    al. subjective wellbeing</a> which aspires to act as an enabler and focus on the\n    quality of human life, taking into account life aspirations and needs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <a\n    href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12181660_On_Happiness_and_Human_Potentials_A_Review_of_Research_on_Hedonic_and_Eudaimonic_Well-Being\">Ryan\n    and Deci</a> further argue about the construct of wellbeing, which draws from\n    two perspectives: the hedonic approach (wellbeing as experience of emotions) and\n    the eudaemonic approach (wellbeing as self-realisation and one’s potential), and\n    stress that intrinsic motivation such as enjoyment enhances wellbeing in\n    contrast to extrinsic goals such as financial success.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Digital interventions for anxiety disorders</h3>\n    <p>\n    Psychological interventions were <a\n    href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28456072/\">proven to be effective for\n    reducing anxiety symptoms</a> together with medication or instead of it. These\n    can include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), relaxation training or\n    mindfulness interventions. Mindfulness interventions have been <a\n    href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22700446/\">successful in reducing anxiety\n    symptoms</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The overwhelming flow of information people experience is highly influenced by\n    technology and can have a negative impact on mental health. On the other hand,\n    as ubiquitous technologies emerge, they provide new opportunities for health and\n    wellbeing interventions. Mobile apps can be a cost-effective way of accessing\n    healthcare. Features such as push notifications, text and media content can <a\n    href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24158428/\">make mobile devices suitable\n    for the delivery of mental health interventions</a>. Therefore, mindfulness\n    interventions are increasingly used in the context of treatment of anxiety.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Behaviour change and motivation</h2>\n    <p>\n    Failure to design interventions that stimulate <a\n    href=\"https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/experiments-on-intrinsic-motivation-and-self-regulation/application-intrinsic-motivation/\">intrinsic\n    motivation</a> can inhibit behaviour change and make users abandon health\n    technologies. <a\n    href=\"https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/the-theory/\">Self-Determination\n    Theory</a> (SDT) in the context of health intervention focuses on the motivation\n    an individual acquires to adopt a new health-related behaviour. SDT embraces the\n    concept of eudaimonia and intrinsic motivation as the core of wellbeing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    There are three psychological aspects that are crucial for psychological growth\n    and overall wellbeing and can lead to long-term behaviour changes. These are\n    <strong>autonomy</strong>, <strong>competence</strong> and\n    <strong>relatedness</strong>. In the Self-Determination Health Behaviour Model,\n    each of these pillars is applied in the context of health.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Pilot Study: mindfulness apps are the preferred way to cope with\n    anxiety</h2>\n    <p>\n    I conducted a pilot study to find out what technologies people use to help them\n    cope with anxiety. The questionnaire revealed that mindfulness mobile apps are\n    the most prevalent. This infomed the course of the study and its focus on\n    mindfulness apps.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Using Headspace to identify motivational aspects</h2>\n    <p>\n    I conducted a 30 day <a\n    href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoethnography\">auto-ethnography</a> on\n    Headspace. The aim was not to generalize findings, as it is subjective in its\n    nature, but rather to inform further study design decisions and app evaluation.\n    Some motivational aspects that I identified during this process:\n    </p>\n    <ol>\n    <li>Gamification of app: streaks, stats of time meditated, sessions completed,\n    and goals\n    <li>Daily reminders or calendar event (opt-in feature): reminder time could be\n    set by the user\n    <li>Mindful messages through push notifications to help the user stay mindful\n    <li>Design to offer a sense of progress: record of all sessions by day, days in\n    pack were numbered and content was prioritised, so the user could start from\n    where they were left\n    <li>Prioritisation of content so that the user can resume from where they were\n    left off\n    <li>Advice on how to create a routine for meditation through animations and\n    during sessions\n    <li>Information about both meditation and anxiety was reassuring of the overall\n    process\n    <li>Instructor reassuring users that good meditation skill takes time and what\n    they might experience\n    <li>Displaying the number of people currently meditating offered a sense of\n    \"social support\"\n    </li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2>Looking at mindfulness apps through the Self-Determination Theory\n    lenses</h2>\n    <p>\n    The data gathered so far offered a good insight into how to design the app\n    evaluation scale. This scale was based on the Self-determination theory, and its\n    three pillars: autonomy, competence, relatedness. The apps reviewed were\n    Headspace, Calm, Breethe, and Simple Habit. All were upgraded to premium trial\n    to allow full access.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>Please refer to <a\n    href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZSYdIx2HKhR60WtpyIBmzVYOvf9tQin/view?usp=sharing\">the\n    paper</a> if you’d like to see the in-depth discussion about the method and its\n    findings.</em>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Conclusion: Implications for design</h2>\n    <p>\n    Best practices found in the apps to facilitate motivation and behaviour change\n    were:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Push notifications</strong>: reminders are useful in order to persuade\n    the user; however, Headspace also offered the \"mindful moments\" feature which\n    can help remind the user multiple times through the day about mindfulness and\n    persuade them to keep meditating. It also offered an event creation in the\n    calendar rather than a reminder, which can increase autonomy by allowing the\n    user to choose how they want to be reminded to be mindful.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Stats</strong>: most apps offered stats in different forms that could be\n    interpreted more or less at glance; <a\n    href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1753326.1753409\">Personal informatics are\n    crucial for people to be able to reflect on their activity and visualise their\n    progress</a>, hence promoting behaviour change.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Information and layout</strong>: all apps were not targeted to anxiety\n    only, offering other support as well (i.e. for sleeping). Categorising and\n    prioritising content can make it easier for users to select the right meditation\n    for them. Information about what the session is about helps users feel more\n    confident with their choice, which increases autonomy and competence. Headspace\n    organises its sessions in packs, which are put in different categories. This\n    allows users to choose what they want to target better. In contrast, Breethe\n    categorises collections by recommended or most popular, which is not necessarily\n    efficient. For example, users with anxiety might want to find the right\n    meditation for anxiety, rather than what most people use.\n    </p>\n  </article>\n</main>\n\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-affective-interaction',\n  templateUrl: './affective-interaction.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./affective-interaction.component.scss']\n})\nexport class AffectiveInteractionComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<nav class=\"breadcrumb\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><a routerLink=\"/\">Alexandra Stoica</a> <span class=\"material-icons md-18\">chevron_right</span></li>\n    <li>Affective Needs in Context: Long-distance Relationships Between International Students and Their Family</li>\n  </ul>\n</nav>\n<main class=\"wrapper-article\">\n  <aside>\n    <dl>\n      <dt class=\"article--label\"><span class=\"material-icons\">menu_book</span>Case study</dt>\n\n      <dt>Date</dt>\n      <dd>08 April 2018</dd>\n\n      <dt>Context</dt>\n      <dd>MSc Human-Computer Interaction, UCL, London, UK</dd>\n\n      <dt>Links</dt>\n      <dd>\n        <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXoBy7px8HhFSxGwNsISQXVBCUzX09Lg/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"pill-button\">\n          <span class=\"material-icons\">open_in_new</span>View paper\n        </a>\n      </dd>\n\n      <dt>Type</dt>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">case study</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">group assignment</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">individual assignment</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">qualitative study</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">university assignment</dd>\n\n      <dt>Methods</dt>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">application of theoretical frameworks</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">auto-ethnography</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">contextual inquiry</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">semi-structured interviews</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">surveys</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">thematic analysis</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">think-aloud</dd>\n    </dl>\n  </aside>\n  <article class=\"article\">\n    <span class=\"article--corner\"></span>\n    <h1>Affective Needs in Context: Long-distance Relationships Between\n      International Students and Their Family</h1>\n    <p class=\"subtitle\">Case study about technology’s impact on affective needs</p>\n    <p>\n    From January to April 2018, I worked on a case study that focused on\n    technological impact on affective needs in the context of long-distance\n    relationships between international students and their families. This study\n    consists of two parts: (1) a qualitative study, conducted as part of a team of\n    six, and (2) an individual analysis of the findings and future directions of\n    technology. This project was part of my MSc Human-Computer Interaction,\n    Affective Interaction module.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    This article summarises a University assignment paper. You can check the <a\n    href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXoBy7px8HhFSxGwNsISQXVBCUzX09Lg/view?usp=sharing\">original\n    paper with in depth analysis and references as PDF</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Emotion’s role in technology</h2>\n    <p>\n    Affective Computing or Interaction aims to bridge the gap between human emotions\n    and technologies. It has been demonstrated that <a\n    href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041708000284\">emotion\n    plays a critical role in our judgement and adaptive regulation of thought</a>.\n    In this article, “affective states”, refers to moods and emotions as embodied\n    reactions or pleasure or displeasure towards something. This is expressed over\n    multiple systems of an organism. For example, not just having happy thoughts and\n    feelings, but also expressing them in the face, body or actions.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Empathy as a tool for understanding experience</h2>\n    <p>\n    When we use technology, we make sense of it, we have certain expectations and\n    biases, but we also <em>feel</em> something towards it. And this also dictates\n    how we use said technology. There are design or theoretical frameworks aimed to\n    support understanding and assessment of emotions in design.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    This study applies <a\n    href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/technology-experience#:~:text=In%20Technology%20as%20Experience%2C%20John,out%3B%20we%20live%20with%20it.\">McCarthy\n    and Wright’s Technology as Experience</a> theoretical framework to understand\n    students’ subjective experience and their affective states when using technology\n    to stay in touch with their families from abroad. The framework is based on the\n    appraisal theory and proposes four threads of holistic experience:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Sensual: how do we engage with this technology?\n    <li>Emotional: what are our reactions and judgements about it?\n    <li>Compositional: how do these elements fit together in a coherent experience?\n    <li>Spatio-temporal: what effects do time and space have on our experience?\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n    Additionally, there are six sense-making processes: anticipating, connecting,\n    interpreting, reflecting, approaching, recounting.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Furthermore, the team consisted of international students which meant we could\n    use our own ethnographic experience to inform the study. We used <a\n    href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326012173_Autoethnography_in_Human-Computer_Interaction_Theory_and_Practice#:~:text=Autoethnography%20is%20an%20ethnographic%20method,of%20other%20observed%20social%20actors.&text=In%20this%20chapter%2C%20I%20will,potential%20implications%20for%20HCI%20research.\">auto-ethnography</a>\n    to apply this theory on our experiences. As a result, we developed a\n    semi-structured interview to understand people’s perceptions and experiences of\n    this topic.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    As <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/negativity-bias-ux/\">people’s\n    ability to self-report their emotions can be limited</a>, we also applied a <a\n    href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/\">think-aloud\n    approach</a> where we asked participants to show us how they interact with their\n    most used technology to contact their family. The think-aloud approach is aimed\n    at the user's interaction behaviour as well as their rationale behind it, and it\n    reinforces reappraisal and helps users verbalise their affective states.\n    Additionally, to enhance reappraisal, we asked participants to focus on a\n    specific time they tried to contact their family and to try to describe how they\n    felt by guiding them with open-ended questions.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Making sense of the data</h2>\n    <p>\n    We interviewed 10 international students from UCL, which were contacted directly\n    and asked to take part in our study. Data analysis was conducted through <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-do-a-thematic-analysis-of-user-interviews\">thematic\n    analysis</a>. Interviews were recorded and transcribed immediately after the\n    session. Each of us performed thematic analysis to define codes and work towards\n    unifying them and discussing what themes emerge from this. We went through an\n    iterative process to refine our findings and formed an affinity diagram to help\n    visualise the themes, concepts and relationships.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Our research found that living far from family can impose some difficulties\n    amongst international students. Homesickness is an affective need that was\n    amongst most prevalent themes and evidence of frustration with technology was\n    found. Additionally, we identified technological barriers such as limited\n    network connection, limited technology experience of the participant’s family,\n    and non-technological barriers such as unaccommodating time zones. Our\n    participants reported they use mostly mobile apps, which means that\n    spatio-temporal aspects are crucial to making a pleasant experience.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>Please refer to <a

Our challenge was to empower a community of our\n    choice through technology. We chose the London vegan community because the\n    number of people who opt for a vegan lifestyle and diet had a 360% increase in\n    the UK in the past decade, representing 22% of the UK population. Despite the\n    rapid adoption, veganism is still a novel concept for many, and it is ridden\n    with stigma, which can indimitate new adopters of this lifestyle. We found a gap\n    in technology in supporting the London vegan community. Our goal was to design a\n    product that would enrich, empower and sustain the vegan lifestyle in London.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Working with 82 members of the community, we applied an iterative design\n    approach, using methods such as: secondary research, contextual inquiry,\n    surveys, low-fi/high-fi prototyping, invision prototyping, think aloud, user\n    testing, to ensure our product fits the community needs through constant user\n    feedback.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>The original paper was written mainly by myself with feedback from the team.\n    All illustrations represented on this page are created by me.</em>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Abstract</h2>\n    <p>\n    As veganism in London expands, the need for a supportive network for vegan\n    Londoners becomes increasingly vital. There are a few digital tools that help it\n    achieve the level of exploration it requires and that are also compatible with\n    their lifestyle choices. In this paper, we present Broccoli, a conceptual mobile\n    application that connects its members through clear visibility to\n    community-contributed content, such as social events, shops, restaurants, and\n    announcements. Additionally we explore leveraging gamification by engaging the\n    user via achievements and their avatar, and access community-reviewed\n    information via tips and questions. Broccoli explores the advantages of\n    augmented-reality (AR) to provide a real-world perception of the user’s\n    contribution and environmental impact. By working closely with 82 members of the\n    London vegan community, we created a product that is superior due to fulfilling\n    the need of a unified and dedicated platform for the community to express\n    itself.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Initial research</h2>\n    <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism\">Veganism</a>\n    is \"<em>a way of living which seeks to exclude all forms of exploitation of, and\n    cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose</em>\".\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Our initial research consisted of secondary research and working with existing\n    sources. To collate our data, we created affinity diagrams, mind maps and\n    proto-personas. From this, three main themes emerged: <strong>veganism</strong>,\n    <strong>community</strong> and <strong>engagement</strong>.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/broccoli/image2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Affinity diagram exploring the three emerging\n        themes: veganism, engagement and community.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n    We found that we can leverage <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gamification\">gamification</a>\n    such as implementing challenges or achievements to <strong>motivate</strong> the\n    user to stay active, and technology such as <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/augmented-reality\">augmented-reality\n    (AR)</a>, customisable avatars and location-based interaction were proven to\n    encourage <strong>engagement</strong>. We decided to explore these approaches\n    and test these hypotheses with our target user group.\n    </p>\n    <h2>User research and findings</h2>\n    <p>\n    From surveying 70 participants during a vegan festival (VegFest London) in\n    person, we found that the London vegans are mostly new to the vegan lifestyle\n    and within the age range of 18-35.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    We also conducted <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/contextual-interviews\">contextual\n    inquiry</a> to gain insight about how they use technology to engage with their\n    lifestyle and community. Our research suggested that London vegans believed that\n    ethical reasons for animal welfare was a strong reason for going vegan, followed\n    by environmental impact and personal health reasons.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Furthermore, we learned that vegans relied on technology (i.e., apps, online\n    platforms, social media) for finding food recommendations and also learning\n    relevant information from community members. Many vegans felt primarily\n    motivated to sustain a vegan lifestyle by seeing their impact on other living\n    beings and also learning new ways to live ethically. Although the London vegan\n    community used various means of technologies to engage, there was a need for a\n    unified platform.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Initial design</h2>\n    <p>\n    Since a majority of our participants stated that their main motivation factors\n    is seeing their impact to some capacity and learning new ways of living\n    ethically, initial brainstorming centred on two particular notions: (1) the need\n    for ubiquitous technology and unified platform of getting relevant information\n    on demand, and (2) the visualisation of one’s impact (i.e., interacting with\n    animals) as they engage with their lifestyle.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Because our studies showed that the vegan community relies heavily on technology\n    to find information, a mobile app was most suitable as smartphones are\n    ubiquitous in our day-to-day lives and the majority of our demographic can\n    incorporate the application into their routines. We focused on three main\n    features within our app:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li><strong>Exploratory View</strong>: we chose this as our centre of\n    interaction where community-generated content will be displayed on a map based\n    on current location or a searched area in London.\n    <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong>: offers a real-world perception and\n    interaction, allowing users to view a real environment with augmented objects,\n    with research suggesting a huge potential in engaging people for\n    concept-learning in education settings and visualising products for consumers.\n    <li><strong>Avatar</strong>: to increase engagement and feeling of involvement,\n    each user will have a customisable avatar representing an animal, vegetable or\n    fruit whose mood changes depending on how much they engage with the community\n    through the app (i.e., attending events, rating businesses).\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Storyboarding</h2>\n    <p>\n    We created some storyboards to help our ideation process and to better visualise\n    how our users could interact with our product.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/broccoli/image3.png\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"image3-desc\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Stroryboarding</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <div id=\"image3-desc\">\n      <p>First row, from left to right:</p>\n      <ol>\n      <li><strong>Entering a vegan restaurant</strong>: The user arrives at a vegan\n      location such as a restaurant\n      <li><strong>Getting notification with tips based on location</strong>: The user\n      can get tips about the place they are visiting\n      <li><strong>Display tip on map</strong>: If the user opens the notification they\n      can see the map and the tips available\n      <li><strong>Share</strong>: the user can now also share tips and reviews about\n      that location\n      </li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>Second row, from left to right:</p>\n      <ol>\n      <li>The user opens the app to search area\n      <li>The user can see shared tips on maps and is able to open them by tapping on\n      the author’s avatar\n      <li>The user can also discover new places via location tags\n      <li>The user can get directions to the location\n      <li>The user can also use AR to find information about a place\n      </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n\n    <h3>AR Ideation</h3>\n    <p>\n    The biggest challenge was to test augmented reality (AR) with our users. As\n    actual implementation was not possible, initially, sketching was used to get\n    quick feedback. Some of my sketches with example features are found below.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/broccoli/image4.png\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"image4-desc\"/>\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> AR ideation sketches</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <div id=\"image4-desc\">\n      <p>\n      From left to right:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n      <li><strong>AR Challenge Concept</strong>: a member of the community can set\n      challenges which the user can get based on location. A challenge can turn into\n      personal goals and when achieved, a new animal will be rescued.\n      <li><strong>Stats view in AR</strong>: it was important for the community to\n      have more visibility to their environmental impact. As such, we introduced\n      statistics which are displayed at a location. The user can take a photo and\n      share it with the community.\n      <li><strong>Share with AR</strong>: the user can share the animals rescued from\n      the AR by taking a picture. They can also add text, and location is added\n      automatically. Once they tap share, the new post is on the exploration map.\n      </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Expert evaluations</h2>\n    <p>\n    I created a few wireframes of our mobile app views from sketches to more <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/high-fidelity-prototypes\">high-fidelity\n    user interfaces</a>. As a team, we conducted <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/heuristic-evaluation\">heuristic\n    evaluation</a> and <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/cognitive-walkthrough\">cognitive\n    walkthrough</a> to assess them.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/broccoli/image5.png\" alt=\"Rough sketches of mobile wireframes\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Rough sketches of mobile wireframes</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n    Following expert evaluation, I changed the tutorial on the first page to a\n    preview of the app and added the tutorial at the end of the first login action,\n    which the user can skip and resume from the app later. I added better spacing\n    and grouping to the input fields for visual clarity and color and underline for\n    links for accessibility.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/broccoli/image6.png\" alt=\"High fidelity mobile wireframes\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> High fidelity mobile wireframes, created in Sketch</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <h2>User evaluation</h2>\n    <p>\n    Applying <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/low-fidelity-prototypes\">low-fidelity\n    techniques</a> for rapid prototyping, we built a <a\n    href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/paper-prototyping\">paper-prototype</a>.\n    Six participants were recruited at a vegan market and asked to navigate the\n    different views and add posts. We encouraged participants to <a\n    href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/\">think-aloud</a>\n    as we wanted to gain immediate thoughts and concerns of specific areas of the\n    application. We wanted to achieve the following:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Evaluate clarity of overall design\n    <li>Assess the ease of performing core tasks (i.e., select a point of interest\n    from the map and interact with the functionality)\n    <li>Decide on whether the usage of AR is effective in displaying the user’s\n    visual impact\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n    Although this reinforced our main features, it helped establish what in\n    particular is important to the users and what should be further addressed:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Firstly, we added more focus and priority to improving the AR functionality and\n    generally making it more functional by adding a stats perspective where users’\n    surroundings are populated with facts about their environmental impact.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Secondly, we changed the point-based rating system from 0 to 5, because we do\n    not want businesses or users to feel competitive in a negative way. We developed\n    the idea of a verified icon that appears if the business/brand on the map has\n    received more than 100 users’ feedback. This will also discourage users from\n    abusing the rating system.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Finally, the main performance of the users will be based on engagement and the\n    rewards given to self-accomplishing a set number of chosen activities to improve\n    their community experience. The user’s lifestyle impact is shown in the\n    evolution or state of the AR animals and their avatar. For example, the higher\n    the user engagement with posting content and attending events in the London\n    community, the higher the positive impact will be reflected in the AR camera\n    view (animals and environment statistics).\n    </p>\n    <h2>High-fidelity prototype & user test</h2>\n    <p>\n    To address the changes above, I created a high-fidelity prototype by programming\n    a mobile app, using <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic</a> and InVision,\n    that would simulate the main features. This provided users with a more interactive\n    experience by receiving a better look and feel of the app. I separated the main\n    functionalities of our app in three tabs at the bottom of the screen to\n    replicate the mobile platform specific design guidelines.\n    </p>\n    <iframe width=\"438\" height=\"930\" src=\"//invis.io/FDXJDGE6CG4\" frameborder=\"0\"\n    allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n    <h3>Exploratory View </h3>\n    <p>\n    The users are presented with a map containing all user content based on the\n    location and a small preview of the user post, following our heuristic\n    evaluation. The user can view more details about a post by tapping on the small\n    preview card at the bottom: as mentioned above the post can be about a business\n    (restaurant/brands), an event, a meetup, a question or an announcement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The user can save a post by tapping the heart icon. They can filter the type of\n    post by tapping the top right button and can add a post themselves by tapping\n    the top left one. The camera button at the top center would open the camera for\n    AR view.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Saved View </h3>\n    <p>\n    This view is divided into post categories. For the purpose of the demo, we\n    divided them into tips, events and questions. Here, they can view posts that\n    they have saved for future reference and also remove them if no longer needed.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Profile View </h3>\n    <p>\n    Upon clicking the profile tab, users will be able to customise and see their own\n    avatar as well as stats about their activity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    We recruited 6 members from the UCL Vegan Society to conduct a usability test\n    and focus group to get feedback about our final product. Similar to our\n    low-fidelity prototype testing, we wanted to know how the participants feel\n    about our product and the implementation of the features. We asked participants\n    to add a post, save a post, view a post and search on the map. We again\n    encouraged them to think-aloud while exploring the prototype. Furthermore, we\n    conducted a focus group to get their ideas on the AR functionality. Some\n    feedback below:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>\"The AR function seemed quite fun and engaging, and the other functions\n    quite easy to use.\"</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>\"Pleasantly surprised! I didn’t know what to expect frankly, but I think it\n    offers something different to the current social media apps.\"</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>\"I liked the AR! And the fact that the app gives you points when you eat\n    vegan food.\"</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>\"I would love to see a beta version of the app to be able to give more\n    detailed feedback about it.\"</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>\"I like the visualisations and unlocking achievements.\"</em>\n    </p>\n  </article>\n</main>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-deat',\n  templateUrl: './deat.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./deat.component.scss']\n})\nexport class DeatComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<nav class=\"breadcrumb\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><a routerLink=\"/\">Alexandra Stoica</a> <span class=\"material-icons md-18\">chevron_right</span></li>\n    <li>Dementia Environmental Assessment Tool</li>\n  </ul>\n</nav>\n<main class=\"wrapper-article\">\n  <aside>\n    <dl>\n      <dt class=\"article--label\"><span class=\"material-icons\">code</span>Dev project</dt>\n\n      <dt>Date</dt>\n      <dd>May 2017</dd>\n\n      <dt>Context</dt>\n      <dd>Media Lab, University of Worcester, UK</dd>\n      <dd>\n        Collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/\">NHS King's Fund</a> and\n        <a href=\"https://www.worcester.ac.uk/about/academic-schools/school-of-allied-health-and-community/allied-health-research/association-for-dementia-studies/home.aspx\">Association for Dementia Studies</a>\n      </dd>\n\n      <dt>Links</dt>\n      <dd>\n        <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.deatapp&hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"pill-button\">\n          <span class=\"material-icons\">open_in_new</span>View on Google Play\n        </a>\n      </dd>\n      <dd>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/alexandrastoica/ionic2-assessment-app\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"pill-button\">\n          <span class=\"material-icons\">open_in_new</span>View on Github\n        </a>\n      </dd>\n\n      <dt>Type</dt>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">mobile app</dd>\n\n      <dt>Languages & Tools</dt>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">Angular</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">HTML5 + Sass</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">Javascript/Typecript</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">PouchDB</dd>\n    </dl>\n  </aside>\n  <article class=\"article\">\n    <span class=\"article--corner\"></span>\n    <h1>Dementia Environmental Assessment Tool</h1>\n    <p class=\"subtitle\">Paper-based tool turned mobile app</p>\n\n    <h2>Challenge</h2>\n    <p>\n    In Year 2 and 3 of my undergraduate studies (2015 - 2017), I worked for\n    University of Worcester's Media Lab. There, I got the opportunity to work with\n    the Association of Dementia Studies, based on campus. They had been working on a\n    <a\n    href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/enhancing-healing-environment/ehe-design-dementia\">paper-based\n    tool for dementia environmental assessment</a>. The tool consisted of a series\n    of questions based on environments which care workers had to evaluate on a 1 to\n    5 scale. The problem they were facing was increasing amounts of data that\n    required tedious manual work with no easy way to analyse it. They were seeking\n    for a better, accessible, and secured way of gathering this data.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    As a result, I built a mobile app for iOS and Android which enabled the\n    centralisation of data and streamlined manual processing by implementing an\n    exporting feature via csv format.\n    </p>\n    <h2></h2>\n    <h2>Initial research</h2>\n    <p>\n    After familiarising myself with the context of the tool, I collated a list of\n    considerations that would help inform the design and development process:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>A mobile app is most suitable because of its ubiquitous nature\n    <li>Protect privacy: secure and anonymise data\n    <li>Care workers would use this app to log in data for patients\n    <li>The app had to be usable offline because many care homes did not have Wi-Fi\n    and couldn’t rely on constant Internet connection\n    <li>Design a user experience that addresses constraints in mobile apps, and the\n    user-group specific needs\n    <li>Ensure W3C accessibility compliance\n    <li>Collaboration with the client in order to set the requirements - we could\n    not undertake user testing ourselves\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Initial design</h2>\n    <p>\n    I designed a simple interface which consisted of three main views:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li><strong>Login view</strong>: to ensure we protect the data, a user had to\n    create a password protected account to be able to use it\n    <li><strong>Profile view</strong>: here you could see your name and email\n    address\n    <li><strong>Assessments view</strong>: this is where all assessments could be\n    managed - add, edit, continue, export, delete an assessment\n    <li><strong>Tutorial view</strong>: this would provide the user with\n    instructions on how to create, complete, export and delete an assessment\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n    The assessment, once opened, displayed a list of categories of the tool and a\n    progress indicator. Each category went through a series of questions, navigable\n    by next and previous buttons.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Data protection</h3>\n    <p>\n    Because the app was collecting personal information, it didn’t ask for\n    identifiable data, to ensure it was anonymised. The user was also encouraged to\n    export the data as soon as possible and delete the assessment from the app.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Technologies</h2>\n    <p>\n    After a few rapid prototypes using just HTML/CSS and <a\n    href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/\">Cordova</a>, we decided on a final design and\n    user flow. This was the time to think about what technologies will enable the\n    implementation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic framework</a> was a good candidate\n    for hybrid mobile development because it came with a library of iOS and Android\n    UI native components which made it easy to rapidly build the interfaces. It was\n    also an efficient way to develop for both mobile platforms.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    At the time of the start of the development process (approx. Summer 2016), Ionic\n    was based on Angularjs. Angular 2 (Typescript) was still in beta, but it was\n    possible to build apps with it by using Ionic 2. I took this as a good\n    opportunity to learn Typescript and the new Angular. The app was scheduled to be\n    used internally in 2017 and possibly released later than that.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    When choosing a database, offline capabilities were crucial. I had recently\n    learnt about <a href=\"https://pouchdb.com/\">PouchDB</a>. It enabled offline\n    syncs, which meant the user could use the app seamlessly and the data would be\n    uploaded in the cloud when the app re-connected to the Internet.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Finally, it was important to find a way to export the assessment in an\n    appropriate format. Previously, the data was manually entered in Microsoft Excel\n    from the paper-based tool. This required a serious amount of time and was prone\n    to human error. To alleviate this, the app offered a csv export feature. From\n    client feedback, email attachment was the most accessible to them. As such, the\n    export feature would open the email app on the phone and add it as attachment to\n    a new email which could be sent. Luckily, Ionic came with a plugins API which\n    enabled native behaviour: the <a\n    href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/social-sharing\">social sharing\n    plugin</a> for opening the email app and the <a\n    href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/file\">file plugin</a> for creating\n    a csv file and adding an attachment.

My choice of focus was on how mixed reality\n    might come into play to support the learning experience by exploring learning\n    theories (i.e., social cognitive theory) and application of the mixed reality\n    continuum. The proposal combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches.\n    This project was part of my MSc Human-Computer Interaction, Future Interfaces\n    module.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    This article summarises a University assignment paper. You can check <a\n    href=\"button\">the\n    original paper with in depth analysis and references as PDF</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Abstract</h2>\n    <p>\n    Ubiquitous technology delivers education new possibilities, shifting from the\n    two-dimensional environment to technology-enhanced simulations which permits\n    students and teachers to go beyond the traditional didactic methods. In this\n    paper we present an e-learning concept that leverages the power of mixed\n    reality. By taking advantage of learning theories and mixed reality, we propose\n    a system that aims to achieve seamless interaction in order to facilitate the\n    learning outcomes, allowing the user to adapt the level of immersion to their\n    needs. We further propose an evaluation plan which aims to assert whether\n    enhancing e-learning with mixed reality is effective and achieves seamlessness.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Why is e-learning important?</h2>\n    <p>\n    As technology becomes ubiquitous, there has been a shift in higher education and\n    pedagogy from traditional education practices towards more self-driven online\n    education. E-learning is the concept and implementation of an online education\n    approach, becoming well established and adapted by multiple educational systems,\n    as modern technologies emerge.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    As an integral part of the educational system, e-learning is an effective tool\n    as it offers flexibility through a wide range of opportunities within academic\n    institutions and not only, for learners or academic qualification seekers to\n    fulfil their educational objectives. On the opposite side, <a\n    href=\"https://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/strategies-e-learning-universities\">it\n    provides teachers, instructors or professors with novel and flexible ways to\n    teach their students</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Graphical vs Tangible user interfaces</h2>\n    <p>\n    In contrast to <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/98326.98408\">graphical\n    user interfaces (GUIs) established by Xerox</a>, which represented a \"desktop\n    metaphor\" that simulates the physical desktop onto the screen, <a\n    href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/258549.258715\">tangible user interfaces</a>\n    (TUIs) augment the physical world by associating digital information to physical\n    objects from the real world, used in the everyday life. Their basis is on the\n    notion of <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/329124.329126\">\"ubiquitous\n    computing\", first coined by Mark Weiser in 1991</a> - a computing and\n    human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigm which attempts to make computers\n    invisible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192426.192428\">Weiser’s vision of\n    ubiquitous (or pervasive) computing was \"invisibility\"</a>. They described the\n    concept of seamless technology as a tool that does not intrude the user's\n    consciousness, allowing them to focus solely on the task they perform, rather\n    than on the technology they interact with. Technology such as AR, MR and VR\n    sustain seamlessness, bridging the gap between the virtual and physical world.\n    Their focus is to <a\n    href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.386\">extend the\n    human-computer interface into the physical space</a> through computer-generated\n    3D objects.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Taking e-learning beyond the GUI</h2>\n    <p>\n    Beyond the graphical user interface (GUI), there has been work around the impact\n    of virtual reality environments (VREs) on learning. There is compelling evidence\n    which shows that <a\n    href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/0142159X.2012.714886\">simulation\n    can improve learner competence and skills compared to traditional\n    approaches</a>. Immersion can vary from low (i.e., illustrated textbooks to low\n    immersion, such\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    as educational games on a computer screen) to high immersion (i.e., educational\n    games presented using a head-mounted display). A study comparing low to high\n    immersion environments in the context of learning suggests that <a\n    href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S1532690XCI1902_02\">higher\n    immersion imposes deeper understanding of concepts</a> and thus more efficient\n    learning.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    According to <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I3AWAAAAIAAJ\">learning\n    theories</a>, immersive environments enhance presence, thus causing the learner\n    to process information more deeply. Through immersion, <a\n    href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/pres.1997.6.6.603\">the virtual environment\n    excludes real world stimuli from the user</a> providing panoramic surroundings\n    that completely put the user in a different place, not just visually. <a\n    href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/105474699566107\">Higher\n    immersion promotes higher presence</a>, which represents the degree to which\n    users feel that they are in an environment that is different from where they\n    actually are.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Additionally, seamless interaction promotes a stronger sense of presence due to\n    the more natural interaction which might result in cognitive load reduction.\n    Hence, it was found that <a\n    href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S1532690XCI1902_02\">students\n    learnt more deeply when the immersion was high</a>, as it promotes engagement\n    and presence.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Finding the place on the Reality-Virtuality Spectrum</h2>\n    <p>\n    Mixed reality (MR) in the e-learning context can provide students a learning\n    environment that clearly shows the disparity between theory and practice as\n    simulation can also represent a prerequisite for <a\n    href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26488981_Mixed_reality_learning_spaces_for_collaborative_experimentation_A_challenge_for_engineering_education_and_training\">learning\n    psychomotor skills whilst providing an in-depth understanding of the theory</a>.\n    By emerging virtual and real worlds, MR can add to e-learning haptic feedback,\n    3D modelling, simulations, just to name a few, creating a seamless interaction.\n    Furthermore, <a\n    href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S1532690XCI1902_02\">narration\n    was found more effective than displayed text</a> in terms of learning outcomes,\n    and <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/292834.292836\">MR can improve\n    collaborative work substantially</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>The proposed system</h2>\n    <p>\n    In the paper, I describe a system that leverages the mixed reality concept in\n    order to enhance the potential of e-learning.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The system is composed of physical objects: a book and a head-mounted display\n    (HMD) with headphones and microphone. The physical book serves as the main user\n    interface. Users can use the book without technology, still being able to read\n    text and view images. Through the HMD, users can see 3D computer-generated\n    objects on top of the pages in AR.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The role of these animated objects is to enable further exploration of the\n    concept presented on the physical book as text or image. The virtual objects\n    come with audio sounds that provide a deeper explanation for the content, in the\n    form of a narration. The user can interact with the system through voice and\n    gestures.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Users are free to explore the book by turning the pages and from multiple\n    perspectives by moving themselves, the book or manipulating the objects through\n    gestures and/or voice - this does not constrain users to remain still or in the\n    same place. In addition to this, VR view enables them to fully immerse into the\n    scene and interact with the objects. By offering the full Reality-Virtuality\n    spectrum, users can adjust the level of immersion and exploration to their needs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    <em>Please refer to <a\n    href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/18lIyR1D1ArGXWBCeqLhxTVyhtf3uVSdH/view?usp=sharing\">the\n    paper</a> if you’d like to see more details and how I propose this system is\n    evaluated.</em>\n    </p>\n\n  </article>\n</main>\n\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  templateUrl: './home.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./home.component.scss']\n})\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() {}\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<header class=\"profile\">\n  <app-profile></app-profile>\n</header>\n\n<main class=\"wrapper\">\n  <section class=\"articles\">\n    <h2>Work</h2>\n    <app-article-card></app-article-card>\n  </section>\n  <section class=\"awards\">\n    <h2>Leadership & awards</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>2020: Leader of the Accessibility Guild at Potato, an initiative created to\n        promote and increase awareness for inclusive and accessible products</li>\n      <li>2019: MSc Thesis <i>“‘Keep Going!’: Understanding the Implications of Coaching\n        through Fitness Apps to Support Physical Training”</i> awarded as <a\n        href=\"https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/content/2-study/4-current-taught-course/1-distinction-projects/12-18/stoica_ralucaalexandra_2018.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Distinction\n        Project on UCL Interaction Centre</a></li>\n      <li>2018: Won a sponsor challenge at HackCambridge 2018 for <a\n        href=\"https://github.com/lexvanderstoep/MedicalBlockchain\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best use of\n        blockchain technology</a></li>\n      <li>2017: Best Computing Student 2017 awarded by the British Computer Society\n        for achieving the highest overall grade in my year and University department</li>\n      <li>2015 & 2016: Two Academic Scholarship Awards for being in top 100 students\n        with highest achievement in Year 1 and Year 2 of undergraduate studies</li>\n    </ul>\n  </section>\n</main>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-potatocon',\n  templateUrl: './potatocon.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./potatocon.component.scss']\n})\nexport class PotatoconComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><a routerLink=\"/\">Alexandra Stoica</a> <span class=\"material-icons md-18\">chevron_right</span></li>\n    <li>PotatoCon</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<main class=\"wrapper-article\">\n  <aside>\n    <dl>\n      <dt class=\"article--label\"><span class=\"material-icons\">code</span>Dev project</dt>\n\n      <dt>Date</dt>\n      <dd>14 September 2017</dd>\n\n      <dt>Context</dt>\n      <dd>Summer Internship at Potato, London, UK</dd>\n\n      <dt>Type</dt>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">mobile app</dd>\n\n      <dt>Languages & Tools</dt>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">Angular</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">Firebase</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">Firebase Cloud Functions</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">HTML5 + Sass</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">Javascript/Typescript</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">ionic framework</dd>\n      <dd class=\"pill\">xcode</dd>\n    </dl>\n  </aside>\n  <article class=\"article\">\n    <span class=\"article--corner\"></span>\n    <h1>PotatoCon</h1>\n    <p class=\"subtitle\">A mobile app for scheduling events and sending out notifications</p>\n    <p>\n    From July to August 2017, during my summer internship at Potato, I designed and\n    developed an app to manage activities, participants, and send hints (location is\n    kept secret and revealed on the day of departure) for the company's annual\n    offsite.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/potatocon/image1.jpg\" alt=\"PotatoCon logo\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> PotatoCon logo (not my design)</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <h2>Challenge</h2>\n    <p>\n    The people team had been planning the offsite every year. This usually takes\n    place in a secret location for a few days. During the offsite, there are various\n    activities that Potatoes can participate in. A few weeks before the departure,\n    the people team starts sending out hints about the location and what to pack.\n    This was all organised, by handing out printed schedules and sending emails.\n    This felt like an opportunity to help alleviate some of the pain points the\n    organisers and Potatoes had.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Initial research</h2>\n    <p>\n    I scheduled a meeting with the people team to learn about their process and pain\n    points. User journeys were used to help visualise this. A few of the pain points\n    for the organisers were:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Having to print out schedules\n    <li>Schedules would get lost\n    <li>People would forget about certain activities\n    <li>Some activities were for a limited number of people and that was difficult\n    to manage without knowing who’s going to participate\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n    From some chats with the Potatoes, I found that they would like:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>to know who else wants to participate to an activity\n    <li>to have a place where they can find the profile of all the Potatoes (since\n    the offsite brought all 3 studios from different locations in the same place)\n    <li>to find the contact information for the people team in case of emergency\n    <li>be reminded of activities\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Preliminary design and requirements</h2>\n    <p>\n    With all this information in mind, I started thinking about requirements and\n    best platforms to help address them. Because during the offsite people would not\n    have laptops with them at all times, and notifications were a recurrent theme, a\n    mobile app was the best choice.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/potatocon/image2.png\" alt=\"Initial PotatoCon wireframes, made in Sketch\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Initial PotatoCon wireframes, made in Sketch</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <h3>Choosing the tech</h3>\n    <p>\n    Having some experience with hybrid mobile app development from the <a\n    routerLink=\"/article/dementia-environmental-assessment-tool\">Dementia\n    Environmental Assessment Tool App</a> I had worked on during Uni, I decided to\n    use the <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic framework</a>. Because I\n    wanted the app to work offline too, <a\n    href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> seemed like a good choice\n    because of it’s Realtime Database quality. I also provided a good way for me to\n    set up a notification system (<a\n    href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions\">Firebase Cloud Functions</a>)\n    and it integrated nicely with Angular via <a\n    href=\"https://github.com/angular/angularfire\">AngularFire</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The hybrid application approach was particularly useful because I had exactly\n    one month to develop this app (or at least a first version), as the year’s\n    offsite was approaching, and it could’ve been a great time to test it out. The\n    benefit of being able to export both iOS and Android apps from the same codebase\n    was saving a lot of time. Ionic also provided platform specific components\n    (inline with iOS and Android guidelines respectively), which was useful for\n    rapid prototyping.\n    </p>\n    <h3>First iteration</h3>\n    <p>\n    I created some wireframes using Sketch and came up with the following\n    requirements:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Login with Google (company) account\n    <li>Timeline of activities (lists hints before the trip)\n    <li>Update timeline to “today” — will be able to scroll to see other days\n    <li>Admins can add and send hints\n    <li>Admins can create and edit activities\n    <li>Admins can set a maximum number of people that can participate\n    <li>Any activity added appears on timeline, as well as on the events list\n    <li>Users can confirm, see who’s attending, see who’s invited to the event\n    through Google Calendar\n    <li>Integration of “Who” (internal app of Potatoes’ details)\n    <li>Users can search for someone, view profiles and emergency contacts\n    <li>Push notifications for hints, new events, event updates\n    <li>Some events/activities were not at the accommodation, so Google Maps was\n    introduced to help with location\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>\n    Using an iterative design approach to gain constant feedback, I created a rapid\n    prototype using Ionic and implemented the UI. After some user tests, some of the\n    feedback was to:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Increase font size and contrast for better readability and accessibility\n    <li>Add more colour in the design (i.e., the header changed to pink instead of\n    white)\n    <li>The statuses (i.e. \"You need to confirm\") were assigned different colours\n    and icons to be easier to spot the different types of events\n    </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Design rationale</h3>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/potatocon/image3.png\" alt=\"PotatoCon workflow\" aria-describedby=\"image3-desc\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> PotatoCon workflow, made in Sketch</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p id=\"image3-desc\">\n    To be able to access the app, users have to login with their company account.\n    Once logged in, they can see a timeline with hints, and events which scrolls to\n    the closest event to date as it goes on. Using the tab menu they can access the\n    events view with lists of upcoming, future and past events which tells them if\n    they need to confirm their attendance, if they have confirmed, if it is fully\n    booked, passed, etc. The admins can add, edit, delete events and send hits (as\n    push notifications). The event view shows a map that opens Google Maps when\n    tapping the blue button, as well as more info about the event. Last but not\n    least, Who, the third tab view, displays a list of people that are attending\n    PotatoCon, and allows you to see their picture, email, slack, or call them.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Final product</h2>\n    <p>\n    The app was designed, developed, tested, and distributed in one month, for both\n    iOS and Android platforms. Although I worked on this project mostly\n    individually, I constantly collaborated with developers, designers and the\n    people team for feedback and improvement. The app was a success, performed well\n    and improved both the organisers’ and Potatoes’ experience.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure role=\"group\" class=\"article--image\">\n      <img src=\"../../assets/img/potatocon/image4.png\" alt=\"Final app screenshots, iOS\" />\n      <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Final app screenshots, iOS</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <h2>PS</h2>\n    <p>\n    Many thanks to <a href=\"http://p.ota.to/\">Potato</a> for an amazing summer\n    internship!\n    </p>\n  </article>\n</main>\n\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-profile',\n  templateUrl: './profile.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./profile.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ProfileComponent implements OnInit {\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n\n  constructor() {\n    // this.name = this.getAttribute('name');\n    // this.description = this.getAttribute('description');\n   }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<div class=\"profile--body\">\n  <h1>Alexandra Stoica</h1>\n  <p>\n    UX/Frontend Enginner @<a href=\"https://p.ota.to/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Potato London</a>.\n    MSc Human-Computer Interaction at UCL (Distinction), London, UK.
