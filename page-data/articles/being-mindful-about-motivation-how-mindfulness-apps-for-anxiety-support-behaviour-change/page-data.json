Categorising and prioritising content can make it easier for users to select the right meditation for them. Information about what the session is about helps users feel more confident with their choice, which increases autonomy and competence. Headspace organises its sessions in packs, which are put in different categories. This allows users to choose what they want to target better. In contrast, Breethe categorises collections by recommended or most popular, which is not necessarily efficient. For example, users with anxiety might want to find the right meditation for anxiety, rather than what most people use.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"being-mindful-about-motivation-how-mindfulness-apps-for-anxiety-support-behaviour-change"}},
